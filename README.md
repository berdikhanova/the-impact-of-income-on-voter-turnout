## Replication of the Burden and Wichowskyâ€™s Cross-Sectional Models of County Turnout and Further Assessment of the Effect of Income on the Voter Turnout in Virginia

Group Project by Marina Berdikhanova, Nina Hamidli and Nguyen Tuan

This memo looks into the effect of the median income and unemployment rate on voter turnout in the state of Virginia. In this paper, we are replicating Table 1, Cross-Sectional Models of County Turnout, of Burden and Wichowsky about Unemployment Rate and Voter Turnout, and extending the study by examining the effect of income on the voter turnout in Virginia. The metric of evaluation in this experiment is the quantile coefficient of the adjusted median income and state unemployment rate. At the end of the study, the successfully replicated Table 1 and non-zero and significant coefficients of the adjusted median income in Virginia will show which class of the state should democratic candidate address more in his electoral campaign.
